# Questions

* Will we have `frontend-app-learning` cloned on the VM images?
  * If so, should we have an `env.config.jsx` in there?
* Will we have the demo course already good to go on the VM images?
  * I updated docs assuming we will.

# TODOs
* Add an example for using installed components to the `tutor-mfe` docs. There's a paragraph talking about "for more complex frontend plugins" but no full example.
