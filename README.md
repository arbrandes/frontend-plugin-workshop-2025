# Frontend Plugin Workshop

This is the full guide was created for the hands-on portions of the Frontend Plugins Workshop at the 2025 Open edX Conference.


## Tracks

We will have multiple presenters and two separate “tracks” for attendees. In addition to a track for site operators to learn the basics of frontend plugins, we’ll have a developer-centered track so they can have a chance to see how Frontend Plugin Framework is used from end-to-end, from developing slots and plugins, to publishing plugins.

Choose the document that matches the track you intend to participate in:

- [Operators](operators/README.md)
- [Developers](developers/README.md)
